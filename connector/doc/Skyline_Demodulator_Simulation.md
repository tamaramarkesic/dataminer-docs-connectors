# Skyline Demodulator Simulation

## About

The Skyline Demodulator Simulation connector is designed to emulate the behavior of a demodulator for demonstration and testing purposes. It provides a virtual environment where demodulator parameters can be monitored and controlled, enabling users to simulate operational scenarios without requiring a physical device.

This makes it suitable for training, proof-of-concept setups, and system demonstrations.

## Key Features

- **Demo and training support**: Suitable for showcasing system capabilities or training personnel without the need for actual hardware.
- **Safe Testing Environment**: Allows safe experimentation with parameter changes and system workflows without risking real equipment.
