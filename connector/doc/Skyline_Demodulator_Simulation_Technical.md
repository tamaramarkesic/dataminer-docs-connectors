# Skyline Demodulator Simulation Technical

## About

The Skyline Demodulator Simulation connector emulates a demodulator, allowing users to adjust and monitor parameters for demonstration and training purposes without requiring physical hardware.

## Configuration

### Connections

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to Use

### General

The General page provides access to key demodulator parameters, such as mode, state, input frequency, carrier modulation, symbol rate, and bit rate. These parameters can be monitored and configured to simulate typical demodulator operations.

### Monitoring

The Monitoring page provides real-time insight into demodulator performance, displaying parameters such as Lock Status, Input Source, L-Band Input Level, C/N Margin, and C/N. These values allow you to assess signal quality, verify lock conditions, and simulate various operational scenarios in a controlled environment.

### Location Details

The Location Details page allows you to specify the demodulator's geographical information, including the location name, latitude, and longitude, providing contextual details for simulation scenarios.
